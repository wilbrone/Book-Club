# Flask Base Application Structure

## By Peter Polle

## Description

This is the basic application structure for a flask micro-framework. It is a time saver for any developer who wants to quickly get started with a flask application without having to create their own application folder structure, installing dependancies and their configurations. This structure hass all the basics and their requirements installed. Happy Coding.

$ source virtual/bin/activate

```

```
4. Make start.sh file executable by running:
